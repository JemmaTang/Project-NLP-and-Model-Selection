# Project-NLP-and-Model-Selection
In this project, I use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.

This dataset is an e-commerce product reviews data.

1. By python programming, I clustered customer reviews into groups and discovered the latent semantic structures.
2. Then, I preprocessed review text by tokenization, stemming, removing stop words and extracted features by Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency(TFIDF).
3. In this project, I used two models, K-means and Latent Dirichlet Analysis(LDA)
